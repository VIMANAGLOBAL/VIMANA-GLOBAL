                        the tokens at the VIMANA Founders’ price of $0.10 per token.</strong> This is the only VAIR block
                    offered at this price point. Other VAIR allocations will be available at a higher price point as the
                    TGE progresses

                    this email with your commitment amount (ETH, BTC, BCH, USD, EUR), or registering your interest via VIMANA
                    TGE Dashboard (click HERE). Once confirmed, I will follow up with the draft agreement and updates on
                    the sale process promptly. <strong>This will be the only opportunity to get Founder’s-level pricing.</strong>
                    Once sold out, prices will increase for the general Pre-Sale
